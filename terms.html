        <h2>1. The Service</h2>
        <p>Triple Peaks is an AI-powered endurance coaching app. By creating an account or using the service, you agree to these terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
        <p>You need a Strava account to sign in. You are responsible for your account activity. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

        <h2>3. AI Coaching Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Triple Peaks provides AI-generated training recommendations. These are <strong>not medical advice</strong>. Always consult a doctor before starting a new training program, especially if you have health conditions. You train at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>4. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
        <p>Subscriptions and in-app purchases are processed through Apple or Google. Their terms govern billing, refunds, and cancellation. You can cancel anytime from your app store subscription settings — access continues until the end of your billing period.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Data</h2>
        <p>Your training data is yours. We use it to provide coaching — see our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details. By using the service, you consent to your data being processed by third-party AI providers to generate coaching recommendations.</p>

        <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>Don't misuse the service. This includes attempting to reverse-engineer the AI, scraping data, creating multiple accounts to abuse the free trial, or using the service for anything illegal.</p>

        <h2>7. Availability</h2>
        <p>We aim to keep the service running reliably but can't guarantee 100% uptime. We may modify or discontinue features with reasonable notice.</p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Triple Peaks is provided "as is". To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for injuries, training setbacks, or any damages resulting from following AI-generated recommendations. Our total liability is limited to the amount you've paid for the service in the past 12 months.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. We will notify you of significant changes in advance.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by applicable law. You retain the protection of the mandatory provisions of the law of your country of residence.</p>
