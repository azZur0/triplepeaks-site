        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>Triple Peaks ("we", "us", "our") respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights under applicable data protection law.</p>
        <p>It applies to triplepeaks.coach, app.triplepeaks.coach, and our iOS and Android apps.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
        <p>
          Lukas Carullo<br>
          Email: <a href="mailto:hello@triplepeaks.coach">hello@triplepeaks.coach</a>
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Account Data</h3>
        <p>Email address, name (optional), and authentication via Strava OAuth. We do not store your Strava password.</p>

        <h3>Training Data</h3>
        <p>When you connect Strava, we receive activity data (duration, distance, pace, heart rate, GPS, power, cadence) and your training history. This is health-related data processed based on your explicit consent.</p>

        <h3>AI-Generated Data</h3>
        <p>Our AI generates training plans, workout analyses, chat responses, and performance insights based on your data.</p>

        <h3>Payment Data</h3>
        <p>Payments are handled entirely by Apple or Google. We only receive subscription status and purchase confirmations — never your payment details.</p>

        <h3>Technical Data</h3>
        <p>Device type, OS, app version, anonymized IP address, and crash reports.</p>

        <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service delivery:</strong> Generating plans, analyzing workouts, adapting training, answering coaching questions.</li>
          <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Weekly plan summaries and account-related emails. Configurable in settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Anonymized, aggregated data to improve the product. Individual data is never shared or sold.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Legal Basis</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Health-related training data (heart rate, GPS, activity data) — based on your explicit consent when connecting Strava.</li>
          <li><strong>Contract:</strong> Processing needed to provide the coaching service (plan generation, analysis, account management).</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> Anonymized analytics, security, fraud prevention.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> Tax and commercial law requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. AI Processing</h2>
        <p>To provide coaching, your training data is sent to a third-party large language model (LLM) provider for processing. Data is encrypted in transit. By using Triple Peaks, you consent to this processing.</p>
        <p>AI recommendations are informational and not a substitute for professional medical or sports science advice. No automated decisions with legal effects are made.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strava:</strong> Activity import via API. You can revoke access anytime in your <a href="https://www.strava.com/settings/apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strava settings</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>LLM Provider:</strong> Third-party AI processing for coaching recommendations. Data is encrypted in transit.</li>
          <li><strong>Apple &amp; Google:</strong> Payment processing for subscriptions and in-app purchases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Some providers are US-based (Google, GitHub, Apple). Transfers are conducted under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework or Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Data is kept while your account is active.</li>
          <li>Personal data is deleted within 30 days of account deletion.</li>
          <li>Backups are purged within 90 days.</li>
          <li>Longer retention may apply where required by tax or commercial law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You can request access, correction, deletion, or export of your data. You can restrict or object to processing, and withdraw consent at any time.</p>
        <p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@triplepeaks.coach">hello@triplepeaks.coach</a>. We respond within 30 days.</p>
        <p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority.</p>

        <h2>11. Cookies</h2>
        <p>Our marketing website does not use cookies or tracking. The app uses only technically necessary cookies for authentication and preferences. No third-party tracking or advertising cookies.</p>

        <h2>12. Security</h2>
        <p>We use TLS encryption for all connections, encryption at rest for sensitive data, access controls, and regular backups. Our database is not publicly accessible.</p>
